CRIME FORECASTING FOR CITY OF PORTLAND

Over the course of the last decade, Crime has seen a steady increase across all major cities in America, and this
creates an uneasiness among the public. With the help of cutting edge computing technologies, we now have
access to a tool that uses machine learning techniques to warn us of the number of crimes which may possibly
occur for a specific instance of time. In this project, I develop an unsupervised machine learning technique with
an external knowledge base, as our input to the Forecasting system which provides with a specific number for
a given location. I use the Spark MLIB for clustering the dataset for creating a structured input for our
forecasting system. The forecasting system puts the ARIMA model to use.

This project aims to predict the number of crimes for every county in the city of Portland in Oregon for a future
instance of time so that it would benefit the PPD(Portland Police Department) thereby reducing or preventing
loss.
